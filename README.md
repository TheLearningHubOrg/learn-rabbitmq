## 1. Stage 1: Absolute Beginner Foundations & Core Architecture
Foundational overview, runtime lifecycle, and modern project setup.

```
Core Paradigm: Master RabbitMQ: Direct, topic & fanout exchanges, consumer acknowledgments, quorum queues, dead-letter routing, and cluster scaling
```

### 1.1 Architectural Foundations
Understanding the core engine execution pipeline and design trade-offs.

---

## 2. Stage 2: Core Syntax & Primitives Mastery
Deep dive into native structures, declarative typing, and error handling.

---

## 3. Stage 3: Internals, Engine & Runtime Deep Dive
Under the hood execution model, memory layout, resource lifecycles, and concurrency.

---

## 4. Stage 4: Advanced Patterns & System Architecture
Scalable design patterns, modular service boundaries, and enterprise integration patterns.

---

## 5. Stage 5: Enterprise Integration & Production Hardening
Security hardening, access controls, compliance protocols, and fault-tolerant mechanisms.

---

## 6. Stage 6: Performance, Profiling & Reliability
High-throughput tuning, profiling, zero-allocation patterns, and observability.

---

## 7. Stage 7: Staff Architect Interview Handbook & Cheatsheet

### 7.1 Enterprise Production Cheatsheet
| Component / Pattern | Production Recommendation | Best Practice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime Configuration** | Strict environment validation | Enforce schema parsing on startup |
| **Error Handling** | Structured domain errors | Never suppress fatal exceptions |
| **Concurrency / I/O** | Non-blocking execution pools | Set explicit bounded queues |
| **Resource Cleanup** | Deterministic teardown | Always register graceful shutdown hooks |

### 7.2 Staff & Principal Architect Interview Q&A (40 Scenarios)

#### Q1: What are the fundamental architectural trade-offs of rabbitmq?
> **Answer**: High-throughput performance and specialized domain efficiency versus operational complexity and ecosystem learning curves.

#### Q2: How do you design for zero-downtime failover and recovery?
> **Answer**: Implement active-passive or active-active replication, automated health check probes, idempotent request boundaries, and circuit breakers.
